📊 Loan Management KPI Analysis

A learning project based on a YouTube tutorial

📘 Overview

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of loan-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
The project was built by following a YouTube tutorial as part of my effort to strengthen my skills in data analysis, pandas, and exploratory data visualisation.

The notebook walks through how to load a loan dataset, clean it, calculate KPIs, and generate useful summary insights.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

Practise Python data analysis workflows using pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn

Understand how to compute common KPIs in loan or credit-related datasets

Improve familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks and reproducible analysis

Learn how to structure a small end-to-end analytic project

This is a learning and skill-building exercise, not a production-ready analytics tool.

🔍 What’s Inside the Notebook

The notebook follows a step-by-step workflow:

1. Data Loading

Import CSV/excel loan data

Inspect data structure (columns, types, missing values)

2. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Convert date columns

Correct data types (numeric, categorical)

Remove or filter invalid records

3. KPI Calculations

Examples of computed metrics include:

Total funded amount

Number of loans

Average interest rate

Loan approval vs. rejection counts

Loan status breakdown (e.g., funded, repaid, defaulted)

Monthly/annual trends in lending activity

4. Visualisation

Simple plots to illustrate:

Loan distributions

Status categories

Funding amounts over time

KPI comparisons

🚀 How to Run the Project
Requirements

Install dependencies (example):

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Steps

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Hanzecode/Loan-Managment-KPI-analysis.git


Open Jupyter Notebook

Run python_kpi_analysis.ipynb

📌 Notes

This project is for learning and practice, not a full professional pipeline.

Code structure and methods closely follow the original YouTube tutorial (link can be added if you want).

You can extend the notebook by adding dashboards, automated reports, or machine-learning predictions.
